# Tools and Software

Linux makes the installation and upgrading of software quick and easy once you know what command to use and how to use them. Most of the tools and software that are available to install on linux based systems are packages that are held in repositories. These repositories are hosted on servers belonging to the different versions of linux as well as many other public and private servers. There are also many mirrors of these repositories that make them consistently and globally accessible. The packages are free to use and develop under their [free and open source](/free-and-open-source-software.md) license agreements.

**Package management**

The easiest way to manage the software packages is using one of the package management tools. By default, ubuntu and debian based versions of linux come with a package manager called Advance Packaging Tool \(apt\) and use the command apt-get. CentOS comes with a packaging tool called yum that is short for **Y**ellow dog **U**pdater, **M**odified. Mac OSX also has a packaging tools available but none are installed by default. One of the most popular is called Homebrew and uses the brew command. The following command can be run to install Homebrew and is found at [http://brew.sh/](http://brew.sh/)

`/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"`

Another package manager that runs on many different platforms and is used to install node based applications is called node package manager \(npm\). Node is a tool for running javascript code.

With these package managers you will be able to install packages like php, ruby, python, .net, mysql, apache and thousands of other software packages.
