# Users, Permissions and Access

Linux based operating systems allow for multiple users at one time. User accounts can be set up with permissions based on a specific user or a group of users. Groups can have zero or more users and permissions can be allocated to any group.

## Basic Permissions

There are 3 basic permissions when it comes to what a user can do, read, write and execute.

Read - this allows a user or group to view a file which includes the name, content, size, etc. Read access on a directory allows the user or group to list the contents of the directory and view the some information about the contents.

Write - this allows a user or group to modify a file. Write access on a directory allows a user or group to modify the contents of the directory i.e. add and delete files.

Execute - this allows a user or group to run a file and execute a script or application. Execute access on a directory allows the user or group to change to that directory and make it their current working directory.
