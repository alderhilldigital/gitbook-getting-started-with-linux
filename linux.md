# Linux

Linux is an Operating System first published in 1991 and is effectively an open source clone of Unix. Many versions of linux have been created since then including Redhat, CentOS and Ubuntu. Many other operating systems are based on the linux kernel including Android OS. Mac OSX is also based on a Unix kernel that pre-dates Linux but maintains a consistent functionality with Linux Operating Systems. If we include both Linux and Unix based Operating Systems, it covers over 90% of the mobile device market, over 75% of the server market and 100% of the super computer and mainframe market. Windows still maintains a majority of the desktop PC market. Being able to work with Linux and the software that Linux supports gives you a big advantage when working in a programming or development environment.

**Interfaces and GUIs**

Linux has a number of different graphical user interfaces \(GUI\) that enable the user to perform tasks via point and click operations using a mouse or track pad. Unity is the GUI that is installed by default when using Ubuntu which is currently the most popular version of Linux. GNOME used to be the most popular GUI, previously the default for Ubuntu and now mainly used on Fedora and Debian versions of Linux. GNOME 3 is still popular with some users because of it's simple interface and use of graphical effects. KDE is also a popular GUI to users who prefer having lots of features and to be able to customise a vast array of options. While these are the 3 most popular GUIs there is one interface that is still more popular than them all, the command Line interface \(CLI\). The CLI is a text-based interface where a user can type in and execute commands. It may take more time to learn the basics of a CLI but, once they have been mastered, many tasks can be completed much more efficiently. Also, since the CLI is relatively consistent across all versions of Linux, there is no need to relearn if you want or need to change.

**Ubuntu** **Installation from USB key**

1. Download a media installation image from [http://www.ubuntu.com/download](http://www.ubuntu.com/download)
2. Insert a USB stick with at least 2GB of memory
3. Download Rufus\(Windows\) or UNetBootin\(Mac OSX\), install the application, open the application and follow the instructions
4. Insert the USB stick into the PCs on which Linux is going to be installed and start or restart the PC
5. If the PC doesn't automatically boot from USB, restart again and press the F12 key to get the boot menu then boot from USB
6. Follow the installation process for Ubuntu

**Ubuntu Installation in a Virtual Machine**

1. Download a media installation image from [http://www.ubuntu.com/download](http://www.ubuntu.com/download)
2. Download Virtual Box from [https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads), install and open the application
3. Start to create a new virtual machine and choose Linux as the type and Ubuntu as the version
4. Continue using the default settings for the remaining options before finalising the new virtual machine
5. Open the new virtual machine and select the Ubuntu media installation image file as the image from which to boot 
6. Follow the installation process for Ubuntu

**Documentation and Help**

As with most software, Linux has documentation that you can use to understand what particular commands do and how they can be used. To access this documentation or "manual" we use the "man" command. This gives a full description of what the command does, the parameters that are required to be passed to it and the options that the user can choose when executing the command. Most commands will also have a brief usage description that can be accessed using the --help option when running the command.



**Exercise**

1. Download and install Virtual Box from the link above.
2. Download the ISO file of the latest Ubuntu release from the link above.
3. Open virtual box and start creating a new virtual machine
4. Name the VM, choose linux type and 64bit version of Ubuntu
5. Keep the default memory and hard drive size settings and create the VM
6. For the new VM right click and choose settings and navigate to the storage section
7. Under 'Controller IDE' add a new optical disk
8. Select the Ubuntu ISO file that was downloaded
9. Start the VM and follow the Ubuntu installation wizard with default settings where possible
10. Once the installation is complete, restart the VM and log in
