# LinuxÂ 

Linux is an Operating System first published in 1991 and is effectively an open source clone of Unix. Many versions of linux have been created since then including Redhat, CentOS and Ubuntu. Many other operating systems are based on the linux kernel including Android OS. Mac OSX is also based on a Unix kernel that pre-dates Linux but maintains a consistent functionality with Linux Operating Systems. If we include both Linux and Unix based Operating Systems, it covers over 90% of the mobile device market
